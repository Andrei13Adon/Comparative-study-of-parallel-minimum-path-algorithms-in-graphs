# Comparative-study-of-parallel-minimum-path-algorithms-in-graphs

The purpose of this project was to determine when parallel algorithms are more efficient then single thread algorithms. To do this study I tested on a graph that had a maze structure. The graph was created with Kruskal and Prim algorithms. The algorithms tested were Dijkstra, A*, Î”-stepping. From this project I've learned how to use threads in Java.

This project has two variables:
  - An variant with graphics that is mostly demonstrative.
  - An variant without graphics that is for time measuring.
